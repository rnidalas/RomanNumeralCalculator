# RomanNumeralCalculator

Project comes with src/ and test/ directories. Both of these
directories have a respective makefile. The makefile in the
top directory will make both. In order to run the test suite
against the Roman Numeral Calculator, run "make check" in the
top directory. This compiles an executable named "check" in the
test/ directory. The unit testing framework will output to the
terminal the results of the unit tests.
